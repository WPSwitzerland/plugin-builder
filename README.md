# WordPress plugin builder

## Description
This is a shell script, which you can run on the command line and which uses
[this boilerplate code](https://github.com/WPSwitzerland/plugin-boilerplate-psr) to automatically set up a new plugin.
It provides you with all that you will need to start working on a WordPress plugin based around code using
PHP namespaces.

## Usage
Run this shell script from the command line: ``./build-wordpress-plugin.sh``. The script will prompt you for the
information it needs.

### On Mac OS
If you're going to use this bash script on Mac OS, you'll first need to replace the default version of ``sed`` with
[the GNU version](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/), so that all of the necessary regular expression functionality
works. You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to do this. When installing, Homebrew instructs on how to adapt the
``PATH``, if one wants to use sed without the g prefix. (``--with-default-names`` is no longer supported.)

```
brew install gnu-sed
```

### Global access
(This applies for Mac OS.) Place a copy of the .sh file in ``/usr/local/bin`` and make it executable.

    cp build-wordpress-plugin.sh /usr/local/bin/build-wordpress-plugin
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/build-wordpress-plugin

Then use ``build-wordpress-plugin`` from the plugin directory of your project.
